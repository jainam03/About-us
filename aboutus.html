                The main motive of designing this tool was to provide a platform where the recruiters would get a chance
                to grade the candidates based on their performance during the interview. It usually happens that after
                the interview, the candidate is only told that he has been selected or rejected but the reason behind
                that decision is not mentioned. It could be because the recruiters don't have much time to express
                candidates performance. After all, they have to interview many other students too. <br> <br>

                So, we thought to design a tool where the recruiter would grade the candidate based on the performance
                in the interview by just making a few clicks 🖱🖱 and not wasting much of their time behind it. ⏲ <br>
                <br>

                It will advantage the candidates because now they have feedback on their interview performance. While it
                would also help recruiters to keep a track of the amount and type of candidates that they've screened by
                the time. The recruiter will just have to make a few selections and the report would get generated and
                mailed to the respective candidate 📩📩. The candidate can use this report to prepare himself for the
                upcoming interviews. <br> <br>

                In case, if you have any queries/problems regarding the tool please feel free to contact us and we would
                get back to you asap! Also, we would be pleased to hear suggestions from you! 🙂 <br> <br>

                Hope that you would find the tool useful and productive.😃 <br> <br>
