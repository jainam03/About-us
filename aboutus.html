    <br> <p id="para">This tool is developed in view of both, the recruiter as well as the intern/student/employee.
        <br>So the general scenario is -  After the interview, the applicant waits for his feedback (may be selected or rejected for his next round). The recruiter or the hiring team does not have time for giving feedback (if the candidate is rejected). <br> Because they have many things like screening other candidate's resumes, etc. No detailed feedback is sent to the candidate (whether he is selected or rejected).
        <br>And hence, we created a tool which will not only help the candidates but also the recruiters. This tool will help the candidate with the mistakes that they made throughout the interview and will help them omprove themselves. To recruiter, it will be helpful to maintain a track of the type and number of candidates that they have interviewed.
