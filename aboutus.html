            This tool is developed in view of both, the recruiter as well as the intern/student/employee.
            <br> Generally what happens is that after the interview is completed the candidate is only informed whether
            he/she is selected or rejected. But, the cadidate has no idea about the reason behind the selection or
            rejection (whatever the case may be) nor the recruiters have that much of time to explain them the
            respective reasons. <br> <br> So, we thought of developing a tool which will, without taking much time of
            the
            recruiter, help them grade the cadidate on their performance in interview.
